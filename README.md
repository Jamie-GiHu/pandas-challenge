 Jamie Tan Pandas Challenge submission on Heroes of Pymoli

# Background
The data dive continues!
In this challenge, the goal is to apply our knowledge about Python Pandas and apply it to analyzing the data for the most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The analysis is presented as a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

# Heroes of Pymoli: Three Observable Trends

1. The customer base of Heroes of Pymoli is predominantly male at 84% of total players. Female players only represent 14% of their customer base but they marginally spend more per item ($3.20 vs. $3.02)and purchase more frequently (1.40 vs. 1.35) than the male players. This could imply player behaviour where non male players have a higher tendency to spend more and buy more optional items to gain an advantage.

2. In terms of age demographics, Heroes of Pymoli is most appealing to the 20-24 age bracket at 45% of total players. Their key demographics are between the ages of 15 to 29 years old as they collectively make up 77% of total players. The 20-24 age bracket has the highest purchase frequency at 1.41 units per person, overindexing against mean of 1.35 units per person.

3. 80% of their total revenue is made up from the sale of 111 most popular items or 62% of 179 items offered. That signifies a wide spread of items that contributes to the Heroes of Pymoli revenue. The wide range of options could potentially suggest high price elasticity and that developers are offering more options to keep the game fresh for players.
